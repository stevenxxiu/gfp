
abp tokenize regex (convert regex which doesn't backtrack into normal tokens)?
	for filters like test.com/[a-z]/spam-result.html

the newest abp doesn't have this (and abp probably won't, due to these filters being uncommon)

do a diff of the current source and abp to make changes easier in the future

abp uses the regex matcher:
	/[^a-z0-9%*][a-z0-9%]{3,}(?=[^a-z0-9%*])/g
	
	to find keywords
	this uses the seperator [^a-z0-9%*]

for regex, will take out all the chunks that must match, and test them individually against the keyword matcher
	this will slow down initialization, but make filter matching fast (due to the math filters like the above)

use abp's default branch

+prefGui.chg exists so only changed filters need to be compiled
	so it needs to know filters internal structures to some extent

+if merge abp's default branch, if filter structures have changed, large portions of the source needs changing too?
	(apart from filter.js and matcher.js these include gui.js, prefGui.js)
