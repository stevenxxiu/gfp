
need to ensure:
	eventListener does not get added more than once
	[done] use preventDefault instead of 'return false'
	[done] 'this' is correct
	make sure elements aren't set custom properties (this is used in event listeners)
		main custom property is setting node.editablegrid, get rid of this

will start modifying 1.0.11 instead
fix bug when there are multiple invalid cells, then select will not save changes

-

adding an event listener with the same function pointer twice will only fire once

-

replaced event listeners:
	editablegrid.js
	editablegrid_charts.js
	editablegrid_utils.js
	editablegrid_validators.js
	editablegrid_editors.js
	editablegrid_renderers.js

make unattach method?

attaching the same functions are ok, since the elements are different when having different tables
this will also prevent attaching twice on the same table
	(cannot attach 2 same event listeners twice)

each cell renderer from now on will only render 1 element (seems to work when editing simultaneously)

---

need to replace:
	element.isEditing
	element.rowIndex
	element.columnIndex

can construct new object or replace these with element tags

will be better to set attributes, since if an external function needs to know the attributes, will need an array storing the object conversions
	otherwise

takes <1ms which is not noticeble

the code fixes a bug when name column shouldn't have simultaneous-editing?

childNodes doesn't have indexOf, so need rowIndex/columnIndex

there are however cellIndex/rowIndex for each element, this actually takes longer, but getting/setting added takes longer than rowIndex

changed to rowIndex/cellIndex
